Git Basics
=============

This Guide will give you a very quick introduction to
git.

After reading this guide, you will know:

* Why you should a version control system like git
* How to use git as a single developer, in  a "one person team"

----------------------------------------------------------------

What is a Revision Control System?
----------------------------------

Revision control (an aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to
documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of
information.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control)

In other words: it's a tool that helps you with your code files, and
with several version of such files.

These systems are known under many names

* version control system (VCS)
* source code manager (SCM)
* revision control system (RCS)

In german they are most commonly called "Versionskontrollsystem".


### A short history of revision control

When we look at open source revision control systems
we find some ancient systems that are no longer in use:

* RCS
* CVS

and several systems that are still in use today:

* SVN, also called Subversion
* Hg, also called Mercurial
* Git

SVN uses a central server. If you cannot reach this server
for a longer time (e.g. because you are travelling and offline)  then
you cannot use the system.

Both Mercurial and Git are distributed systems, they
do not need a central server. You can use the full system on
your own machine while offline.

### Why use revision control?

There are good reasons to use revision control even in
small projects:

1. The whole history of the project always accessible, you can "go back in time" to old versions of your code.
2. You can try out experimental stuff without danger of breaking your existing code.  

And it's absolutely vital for teamwork - several people can develop on separate machines. The system helps with merging the differet programs into one.

### Why use git?

Git was invented by Linus Torvalds, 
to manage the source of the linux kernel and it's many contributors.
See [this video of a talk by him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8).

Git is a **distributed vcs** - it does not depend on one central repository, every
repository is created equal. You  can transfer code in "both directions".
You can work online and offline. Its architecture is not fixed: if one server
breaks down, you can move to a new server without any trouble.

Branching and merging is easy in git.

In your local working copy you also have a fully fledged repository:
it's stored in one directory: `.git`.

All the code you check in is identified by SHA1. You cannot change the
content of a commit after it has been made without the hash breaking!

### gitlab and github.com#

Gitlab is an open source project that adds a web frontend to
git repositories.  It is often used in companies and universities
to host git repositories internally.  (At Salzburg University of Applied Science
we use it at [git.mediacube.at](https://git.mediacube.at).

Github.com is a commercial hoster for git repositories.
They also offer a web interface and add a lot of convenient features to git.
It's free for open source projects and used by many such projects. You can
also host your code for free if you opensource it (even if noone else ever uses it).

Githubs mascot is the octocat:

Git Basics 
----------

Where is my code?  There are four answers to this question, four "places" that
you need to learn about:

![git-transport](images/git-1-places.svg)

* the *workspace* is what you see in your computers file system
* the *index* is an invisible space where you can *add*  files you want to commit (see [what's the deal with the git index](http://www.gitguys.com/topics/whats-the-deal-with-the-git-index/))
* you can always commit to your *local repository* - it's really stored in the `.git` folder
* a *remote repository* can be on another computer. it may not be reachable all the time


### Configuring Git

Before you start working with git you should configure
your name and e-mail address.  This information will be 
added to all commits you make.  (So if you want to work
anonymously get a new e-mail address for this)

* use the command "git config"
* for a specific repository  the information is stored in .git/config
* for a user is stored in ~/.gitconfig
* use "git config --global" to change your user config

This is how you save the information:

``` sh
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
$ git config --global user.email "me@fh-salzburg.ac.at"
$ git config --list --global
# user.name=Firstname Lastname
# user.email=me@fh-salzburg.ac.at
```

### Create a Repository from scratch

When you start a new project and have no data
yet you can start like this:

``` sh
mkdir project_directory
cd project_directory
git init
# creates subdirectory .git
# repository is stored in there
# .git/config 
```

If you are working on windows but collaborating
with developers on other systems you might want to
configure which line endings and which external editor is used.
change the following setting:

``` sh
core.autocrlf false
core.editor "C:/Programme/Notepad++/Notepad++.exe"
```

### Plain git Workflow

The "innermost loop" of working with git
is the "commit":  a change in one or severl files
that belong together.  This is how you create a commit:

``` sh
# what's up?
git status

# i've created or edited a file
git add FILE

# i've created and/or edited a lot of files
git add .

git commit -m "describe the commit"
```

The "add" command puts your changes into the
staging area, the "commit" commands saves them
to the local repository.  

The staging area is the place where you collect
the pieces that will make up a commit.

![git-transport](images/git-2-commit.svg)



Workspace ("working copy") is managed by git!


### Git adds content, not just filenames

A word of warning: The "add" command puts
the content of the added file into the staging area,
not just the filename.

Try out the following sequence with a file of your own:

``` sh
# change FILE
git add FILE
# change FILE again
git status
# you will find the FILE mentioned both under
#  "Changes to be committed" and under "Changes not staged for commit"
git diff
# between the staged version and the current version
git diff --staged 
# between the staged version and the last commit
```

You will find that the first change has been staged,
but the second one has not.  Therefore: only add your
files when you are sure you are done.

### Deleting a file from git

If you want to delete a file from the repository
you should use the command

``` sh
git rm FILE
```

This removes the FILE from the file system and
at the same time addes the information to the staging area.
so on the next commit the deletion will be entered into
the repository.

If you just delete the file from the file system
the process get's a bit more inconvenient.  `git status` will
show you 

``` sh
rm README
git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#       deleted:    README
git rm README
```

On the last line there you have to type in the filename again. And you
won't have any help from your shell (like autocompletion) because
the file is not there any more.

After the commit the file will no longer show up when we
use the repository. But the information is still there! You
can still go back to the previous commit and thus "resurrect" the file.


### Rename a File

``` sh
git mv SOURCE DESTINATION
```


### What is a good commit?

When implementing a feature or fixing a bug you will usually need several commits to get the work done.
Or maybe it's the other way round: when you work with git you will soon find that making several
small commits is quite convenient, because it helps you structure (and maybe undo) your work.
Even if you made several changes, you can split those up  into two commits by first adding
and commiting one set of files, and then adding and commiting the rest.


If - on the other hand - you do not want to add the files by hand
there is a convenient way to commiting all the changes at once: add
the `-a`  flag to the commit:


``` sh
git commit -a -m 'some stuff i did'
```

Remote Repositories
-------------------

You can work with several remote repositories. The most
important remote repository is usually called `origin`.

### Adding a Remote Repository

If you created the repository locally you can connect it
to a remote repository later on:

````SH
git add remote origin https://github.com/myname/myrepository.git
```

Look into `.git/config` to find the information again.

### Clone an existing repository

When you want to work with an existing remote repository
you need to find out the repositories URL.  The URLs may
start with http, https, ssh, or git.  Two examples are:

* `https://github.com/web-engineering/web-engineering-textbook`
* `git@github.com:web-engineering/web-engineering-textbook`

To get the data for the first time use the `clone` command:

``` sh
git clone REPOSITORY_URL
git clone REPOSITORY_URL DIR_NAME
```

If you do not specify a directory name, the last part of the
URL will be used.  The clone command will implicitly set the
origin to the repository url, you don't need to type:

``` sh
git remote add origin REPOSITORY_URL
```

### workflow with remote

When working with a remote repositories you need two now
commands: `push` and `pull`.


![git-transport](images/git-4-remote.svg)

When you push your local commits to the remote repository
you have to specify a local branch and the name of the remote repository.
When you haven't worked with branches yet there is only the `master` branch.

``` sh
git push origin master
```

When you pull changes from the remote repository you havt
to specify the local branch again (probably `master`) and 
the name of the remote repository.

``` sh
git pull origin master
```

Now you are ready to work with git on your own.  You can make
a backup or publish to the world by pushing to a remote
repository.

But if you want to work in a team you will need to handle branches.
